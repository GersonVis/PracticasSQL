-- Group by
-- sentence: select columns_name from name_table group by column_name
/* create a group after the result, will do the operation by group
*/

select author_id, sum(sales) as sum_sales from books group by(author_id) order by sum_sales desc;
-- get the lowest-selling book by an autor
select title, author_id, min(sales) as min_sales from books group by author_id;
-- average sales per author
select author_id, avg(sales) as avg_sales from books group by author_id;

-- HAVING
-- this help us by make conditios after a group by or agrupation functions
-- sentence: selct sum(sales) from books group by column_name having sum(column_name)>/</!=/= number or other condition;
-- example

-- UNION
-- setence: sentence_one union sentence_two;
-- this sentence join the result of two sentences, the sentences must, used the same alias with "as"

-- get the union between users and authors with alias full_name
select concat(first_name, " ", last_name) as "Full name" from authors
union
select concat(first_name, " ", last_name) as "Full name" from users;


-- sub queries

-- example
-- get the full name of authors with higher more than average sales

select concat(first_name, " ", last_name) as "Full name"
from authors 
where author_id 
in (select author_id from books group by author_id having avg(sales)>(select avg(sales) from books));
-- other form
set @sales_average=(select avg(sales) from books);
set @author_ids=(select author_id from books group by author_id having avg(sales)>@sales_average);

select concat(first_name, " ", last_name) as "Full name"
from authors 
where author_id 
in (@author_ids);
